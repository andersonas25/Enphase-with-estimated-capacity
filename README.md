# Enphase-with-estimated-capacity
The enphase Web site provides Array capaicy based on DC watts panel type logitude and lattitude.  And other factors such as 
age of the panels.  In the Settings page go to the Array Details and you will find a AC WATTs in Kilo watt for each month.  
Take the monthly estiamte and divide by the days in the month. This should give you a daily estimate.  

For example my array December estinmate is 9.4548 Kwh, while the June Daily estimate is 15.7633 KWh

You can enter a Daily estimate for each month.  You will then have a tile listing the expected Daily estimate and
another tile showing the percent generate so far that day.
